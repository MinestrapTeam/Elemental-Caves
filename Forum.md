[u]Elemental Caves[/u] - A whole new way to explore. Modjam #4 entry as well.

[size=5][b]OVERVIEW[/b][/size]

Elemental Caves are new "underground biomes" that generate within the Overworld's labyrinth tunnels. At the moment, there are three varieties of these caves: Ice, Fire, and Forest. However, we have many others planned for the future.
While the caves differ vastly in blocks and effects, three main things are consistent between each cave type: each has a new stone type, a transformative crystal, and a tool and armor set.
When playing survival mode, it is recommended that you start out in the Forest Cave, and then work your way up to the Ice and then Fire Caves, which are more difficult to traverse.

[size=2]These are the caves in order of progression (which ones you should visit first to last).[/size]

[size=4]Forest Caves generate in forest and jungle biomes. They have rich grass and rich soil as their floor, and have Ancient Moss Stone as the sides. The forest crystals spawn on the roof, and constantly bonemeal the rich grass, causing a plethora of grass and flowers to spawn on the floor. It makes it difficult to navigate.[/size]

[size=4][u]Ice Caves[/u][/size]

[size=4]Ice Caves generate in cold biomes. They have ancient ice for flooring, and Glacierrock for the sides and ceiling. Ice crystals spawn on the roof, which can be used to freeze things.[/size]

[size=4][u]Fire Caves[/u][/size]

[size=4]Fire caves spawn in warm biomes. They have a ceiling and wall of Moltenstone. Their floor is made of entirely lava(Not shown in picture). Fire crystals spawn on the ceiling which can be used to melt things.[/size]
